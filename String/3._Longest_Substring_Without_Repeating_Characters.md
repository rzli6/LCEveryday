# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

2020/05/13 ZLY

### Problem Description

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

### Algorithm

We use a sliding window to scan through the string and a dictionary to record the last occurence index of each character in the string. When we slide the window, we move the end position by 1 index each time. Then we use the dictionary to help us decide the start position. Finally, we can get the length of window by `end-start+1` each time. The final goal is to find the largest length of the window.

For example, for string `"abba"`, when we set the end position to be the second `b` (index 2), by looking at the dictionary, we can see that last occurence of `'b'` is at index 1. Therefore, we set the start position to be `1+1=2`, now the length is `2-2+1=0`. Next we set the end position to be the last character `'a'` (index 3). The dictionary tells the last occurence of `'a'` is at index 0. Then this time, the start position should be the larger one between `0+1=1` and the previous start position `2`. Therefore, now the start position is still `2`.

### Code

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
    record_index = {}
    result = 0
    start = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in record_index:
            # update the start position
            start = max(record_index[s[i]]+1,start)
        # move end position by 1 index each time
        end = i
        # keep the larger length
        result = max(end-start+1,result)
        # update the record index
        record_index[s[i]] = i
    return result
```
