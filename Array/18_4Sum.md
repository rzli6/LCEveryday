## Problem
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.  

Example:  
```
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```

## kSum Idea

kSum problem can be divided into two parts:  
1. 2Sum Problem
2. Reduce K sum to k-1 sum problem

Time complexity: O(n^3)  
Space complexity: O(n)
